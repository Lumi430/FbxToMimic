# FbxToMimic [Not Yet Working]

## Notice
- Documentation quality needs to be increased for easier group work
- This project is being developed in Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS

## Goal

The [DeepMimic project](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic) currently offers no way to import custom reference motions. This is shown in [DeepMimic issue #23](https://github.com/xbpeng/DeepMimic/issues/23). This project aims to transfer animation data from .FBX files into DeepMimic Motion files. Motion files can then be used to Train DeepMimic skills.

## Progress

- FBX files (v6.1.0)(ASCII) are converted to fbx.JSON
- fbx.JSON files are converted to DeepMimic Motion files

## Prepairing your .fbx files

JsonToMimic.py is not currently able to work with rotation data unless there is a return character after every ",L,".
This means the euler rotation data for animations inside .fbx files must be formatted as shown.

If your files are not formatted as shown above, they can be fixed with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
### fixing your .fbx files

- Import your file into Blender
- Export as .fbx

- In the bottom left, make sure you export as FBX 6.1 ASCII

## Running the project

```Bash
python FbxToMimic.py
```

Will convert all .fbx files located in ./InputFbx/ into Mimic Motion files, located in ./OutputMimic/
